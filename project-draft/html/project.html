            Many people have health problems related to eating, and our group members can all personally relate to the topic of nutrition and diet.Currently, there are no applications that provide the localization of data/easy to visualize on a platform that comprehends information of ingredients for all meals for general users. We believe that an application that consists of all eating information and habits together would be beneficial to any user. <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/zh-CN">MyFitnessPal</a> focuses on calories and food groups but doesn’t focus on previous/current eating history. <a href="https://www.boohee.com/"> Mint Health(薄荷健康 )</a> is similar that it records calories but not ingredients. Our application would provide inclusion to a wider range of users who can have access to more functionalities than similar platforms. By focusing on ingredients and by recording all meals eaten, we hope that the app can reveal a pattern over time for the user’s own health benefit. We plan on looking for an AI that could assist in complex analysis. Having a platform that could have all this information and goals in one place can be beneficial for someone’s physical and mental health.

                The application's primary purpose is to help people with digestive issues or those who are health-conscious to keep track of what they are eating and maintain a digital record of it for future reference. The app will be accessible to anyone interested in nutrition and diet management, and it will positively impact racial minority groups by providing them with access to information and tools to monitor their eating habits.
